"""A complete, working plugin, kept small enough to read in one sitting.

It does something trivial — takes a name, has an agent write a greeting, and
asks you before it counts as done — but it exercises every part of the
contract: a pipeline, a room with a bench, an agent with a job, a gate, a
hook, a record schema, prompts and a self-check.

This is a TEMPLATE. Clone it into `plugins/<your_plugin>/`, rename `id` and
`name` below, and replace the contents. Nothing else in the environment needs
to change: installing a plugin is putting it in `plugins/` and restarting.

    <your_plugin>/
        plugin.py          this file — the only required one
        rooms/hall.yaml    optional: rooms as YAML, read by a helper
        prompts/greeter/   optional: prompt text, read by a helper
        tests/             optional, and the first thing to keep

The environment never looks in those directories. `rooms()` and `prompt()`
below call helpers that do; a plugin that builds its rooms in Python or
fetches its prompts from a database answers the same questions differently and
works just as well.

One trap, worth knowing before you install this unchanged: a record with no
explicit `kind` falls back to the FIRST pipeline alphabetically. Installed as
`example`, this one wins that race, and every transition in an existing ledger
is then refused for being off `greeting`'s table. Give your plugin its own id
and its own kind before you put it next to real work.

`docs/CONTRACT.md` is the full reference; `README.md` is the walkthrough.
